BLACK, INDIGENOUS, AND LATINX IN TECH (B[U]ILT)
B[U]ILT is a student organization fighting for racial equity in the tech industry and in academia. We aim to provide individuals of said races and their allies with what is needed to advocate for and achieve racial equality in tech. In the past, we have moved towards this goal through things like career events, community discussions, and talks with industry professionals.
